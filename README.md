## Overview:
Bulletin is a collaborative calendar app that allows users to add multiple people to the same calendar to allow for easy coordination of events between groups of people.

## Features:
- Add multiple people to the same calendar, which are called Bulletins
- Multiple people can add events to each Bulletin that they are a part of
- Notifications for events
- To-Do list
- Group chat for each Bulletin
- Pictures can be added to each event within a Bulletin to create a picture collage of the group's past events
- Custom themes can be added to each Bulletin

## How to Install:
1. Install IntelliJ Idea from the link in the Download Requirements section (both Community and Ultimate Editions will work)
2. Make sure the JDK for Java 15 is installed (if not use link below)
3. Open IntelliJ and make sure it correctly identifies your JDK and can run java programs.
4. Clone this repository into any accessible directory of your choice.
5. Open the cloned repository with IntelliJ
6. Download the SDK for JavaFX using the link below and set up JavaFX on your project using the Getting Started link (make sure the VM options that are mentioned are set on the class called Main).
7. Once JavaFX is set up, download the jar for JSON.simple using the link below.
8. Similar to how you set up the JavaFX SDK, add the JSON.simple jar as a library to the Bulletin project.
9. Run the program by opening Main.java and right clicking and pressing run (if errors are thrown this is most likely because you VM options are not set, so go back into the Getting Started link and make sure you have done this).
